{"name":"QOPQDP","tagline":"SciDAC QFT Operations library built on QDP","body":"QOPQDP is an implementation of the SciDAC Level 3 QOP (QCD OPerations) API on top of the QDP/C library. The goal is to provide a complete reference implementation of the QOP API that is both portable to all platforms and at the same time well optimized for many platforms.\r\n\r\nThe QOPQDP package currently contains:\r\n\r\n* Gauge:\r\n* * Symanzik 1-loop force\r\n* Asqtad:\r\n* * dslash\r\n* * inverter (single and multimass)\r\n* * force\r\n* Wilson:\r\n* * dslash (with anisotropic clover)\r\n* * inverter\r\n* Domain Wall:\r\n* * inverter\r\n\r\nCurrent and past releases can be found [here](http://usqcd-software.github.io/downloads/qopqdp)\r\n\r\nThere is now a simple installer for SciDAC software packages called qinstall. Instructions for it's use can be found here.\r\n\r\n*** NOTE: versions 0.16.0 added two new members to QOP_resid_arg_t. Set new member relmin to zero for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n*** NOTE: versions 0.11.0 and higher now require QDP version 1.8.0 or higher. Likewise versions before 0.11.0 require QDP versions before 1.8.0.\r\n\r\n*** NOTE: as of version 0.9.0 the Asqtad inverter conventions have changed. See the README below for more details ***\r\n\r\nThe installation options can be found in the README file. \r\n\r\nThe documentation for QOP is [here](./qop)\r\n\r\nThe materials from the SciDAC 2007 tutorial are [here](http://web.mit.edu/bgl/scidac-2007)\r\nSome simple step-by-step instructions for installing QOPQDP and all it's dependencies (QDP/C, QLA, QIO and QMP) can be found [here](./installation.txt)\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this development comes from the U.S. Dept. of Energy SciDAC program. See the [USQCD](http://usqcd-software.github.io) home pages for more details.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
